I apologize for the ongoing confusion. It seems thereâ€™s still an issue with how the Markdown is being presented or interpreted. Based on your feedback, Iâ€™ll simplify and ensure the entire README is provided as a single, clean Markdown code block, ready to be copied directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub. Iâ€™ll also double-check the formatting to match the style you shared in the screenshot (using `#` for headings, bullet points, and proper code blocks for commands).

Hereâ€™s the complete README, fully enclosed in a Markdown code block:

This should now work perfectly as a GitHub README, rendering with proper headings (`#`), bullet points, and code blocks (````bash`). If it still doesnâ€™t work or if thereâ€™s a specific issue (e.g., rendering, formatting, or GitHub display), please let me know, and Iâ€™ll troubleshoot further or provide additional guidance. Iâ€™m committed to getting this right for you!
